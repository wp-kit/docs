# wp-kit/theme docs

`wp-kit` has changed alot between versions 1.0 and 2.0. The documentation has two separate areas to deal with these differences. 

## Version 1.0

`wp-kit 1.0` relies on [```wp-kit/core```](https://github.com/wp-kit/core) to provide all of the core features. These documentaton for these features have been broken down into individual README files:

[Read Docs for V1](v1/README.md)

## Version 2.0

`wp-kit/theme:2.*` depends on several wp-kit components which were originally a part of ```wp-kit/core```.

This major change in `wp-kit/theme:2.*` is to allow more flexibility in adding ServiceProviders to `wp-kit/theme` and results in an unavoidable overhaul that deems `wp-kit/core` redundant.

These documentaton for these features have been broken down into links to individual component repository README files:
